Redmine Issue Templates Plugin
======================

This plugin adds the ability to create and use issue templates.
You can manage templates generation and visibility through roles, permissions and projects.

Note that this plugin now depends on [redmine_base_select2](https://github.com/jbbarth/redmine_base_select2).
